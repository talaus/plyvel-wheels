Why does this fork exist?
--------------------------

The sole reason for this fork existing is to provide cross platform wheels for
ease of installation - Namely on Mac and Windows which do not currently have bundled leveldb
libraries. (This repo was previously named plyvel-win32 as it was only for windows)

In other words, I am compiling the C++ leveldb -> x86-64 binaries + doing
the cython build and wheel creation so that you don't have to. I have no intention
of doing any development work on plyvel beyond this - please continue to use
the main repository for all other purposes.

To install:

.. code-block:: python

    > py -3.9 -m pip install plyvel-wheels

Then use like you normally use plyvel:

.. code-block:: python

    import plyvel
    db = plyvel.DB('/tmp/testdb/', create_if_missing=True)

Note:
-----
There is a single failing test for windows:

- `test_open_read_only_dir`

Where there is a discrepancy in the type of error message that is thrown when trying to access a
db in a read-only directory. I am unsure if this is of any significance in practice.
